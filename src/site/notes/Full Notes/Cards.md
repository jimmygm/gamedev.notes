# Cards

Cards games are an interesting case, because they were not created with the digitalization of video games, but first as physical representations, after the invention of paper. They could either be simple enough like poker cards, which are used to create several different games or, as a set of a single purpose game like Uno, Yu Gi Oh or Magic.

Cards games are originally indented to be played with other people, but it is quite interesting that in video games, there has been another trend coming up, and this is about single player card games.

Games in which part of the mechanics is not using those cards against other players, but instead, as options or ways of modifying the world around it. ([[Full Notes/Slay the Spire\|Slay the Spire]])
