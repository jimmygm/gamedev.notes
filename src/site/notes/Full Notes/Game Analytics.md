# Game Analytics

Game Analytics refers to the collection, analysis, and interpretation of player data in games. 

The key difference between this and regular feedback is that analytics shows what players actually do, rather than what they say they do or want. It's often more reliable for understanding real player behavior.

Metrics:  Quantitative measurements of player behavior
Examples:

- Play time
- Level completion rates
- Feature usage
- Player retention
- Death locations
- Most used weapons/items

Telemetry: The actual process of collecting data remotely. Raw data gathering from player sessions
Example: 

- Recording every jump location in a platformer


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Specific metrics that measure success
Examples:

- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)
- Churn Rate (players who stop playing)

Types of Analysis:

Behavioral Analytics

- How players interact with the game
- Player patterns and preferences
- Common strategies or paths taken


Performance Analytics

- Technical aspects
- Frame rates
- Crash reports
- Loading times


User Experience (UX) Analytics

- UI interaction patterns
- Menu navigation
- Tutorial completion rates

This type of feedback is:

- Data-driven
- Objective
- Based on actual player behavior (not just what they say)
- Useful for making informed design decisions
