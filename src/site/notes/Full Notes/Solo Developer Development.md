# Solo Developer Development

Creating a game by yourself is not something that a lot of people have done successfully. There is a reason that video games are a billion-dollar industry. This is why in this note, I would like to research and create a comprehensive development cycle for someone doing everything alone.

| Topic         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Expectations  | Money: Most likely you will not live out of this, at least for your first attempts, very few people have accomplished that, so if the probabilities are against you, do not assume you will be a ticket winner, DO NOT QUIT YOUR JOB. <br><br>But as with everything in life, you get better chances with more attempts, incremental improvements and consistent results.<br><br>Spending: Do you plan on spending money on this? I would advise you against it unless you already have a proven formula to get it back. Release a couple of games first and see how much you get out of it. |
| Concept       | Think in simple terms, something that could be created in the span of a year.<br><br>Innovative: Expect them to take more time and feedback.<br><br>Niche: Make sure your mechanics have already been proven to be fun, do some research first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Documentation | Be very descriptive about the game mechanics, avoid vague descriptions and use pseudo code as much as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Management    | Time: Most likely you already have a job, you plan to work on this during your days off or after work. As such, treat it as a hobby, two keywords, burnout and development hell.<br><br>Avoid burnout, create a flexible workflow that allows you to resume your development at any time regardless of your own circumstances.<br><br>Do not fall for development hell, that is to say, have a clear deadline in mind and take shortcuts as needed to complete it. If you are trying to create the Mona Lisa, then expect years of your life to be the payment for it.                       |
| Production    | Skills: Evaluate your skills and if possible, try to create a game based on your strengths. If your concept doesn't allow it, then that's fine, but be prepared for deep learning curves.<br><br>[[Full Notes/Assets\|Assets]]: There are a lot of free assets available on internet, make use of them as much as possible.<br><br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Full Notes/Feedback\|Feedback]]  | Some example of getting feedback as a solo developer:<br><br>[[Demo\|Demo]]: You can publish it on Steam or any other game store.<br>[[Early Access\|Early Access]]: Again, Steam is your best tool for this one.<br>[[Full Notes/Social Medias\|Social Medias]]: There are specific forums and groups where people are interested in trying out amateur games, take advantage of those.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
